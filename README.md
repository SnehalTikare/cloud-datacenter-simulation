# Homework 1 - Cloud Simulation
## Description: 
Create simulations for evaluate of different characteristics and deployment models in a datacenter and studying their results

## Overview
This assignment simulates the working of datacenter and various service implementation in cloud computing.The assignment
uses Cloud Sim plus framework to simulate the model and is developed using Scala.It shows various implementation
of scheduling and allocation policies and their effects on execution time, provision of resources.It also shows
the result configuring parameters and their effect on the allocation.
